# AGENTS.md

At Your Pace: a Vite + TypeScript qi gong trainer. The teacher (a built-in
figure or an imported video) advances only as the learner, tracked by MediaPipe
through the webcam, matches its pose.

## Layout

- `src/skeleton.ts`: poses, segments, features (body shape) and drawing helpers.
  `Posture` ('standing' | 'seated') decides which segments count and how the body is scaled.
- `src/follower.ts`: `Reference` (a teacher's move) and `Follower`, which keeps the teacher in step with the learner.
- `src/moves.ts`: built-in moves as keyframes, and the figure drawn from them. Each `Move` lists the `postures` it supports.
- `src/main.ts`, `index.html`, `src/style.css`: the app.

## Tests and checks

Run each once, after your last edit:

- `npm run check` (`tsc --noEmit`): type-check. Run after any change to `src/`.
- `npm test` (`vitest run`): unit tests in `src/*.test.ts`. Run after changing matching, following or moves.
  Add tests for new behaviour there.
- `npm run build` (type-check plus `vite build`): run when you touch `index.html`, CSS, imports or build config.

The app itself needs a webcam; the "simulated student" button exercises it without one.
